<b>Welcome to my Digital native research website for after the midterms.</b>

<p>This website will look a little bit messy, the theme of the website is early 2000s/2010s webblog, to reflect the aesthetics of Flickr.</p>

<p>If it is annoying you, I recommend to turn on reader mode on your Iphone or Mac, although it might not work with Flickr embed images.</p>

<p>I am using many photos from Flickr on this page, these are clickable, to be transparent about the source.</p>

<b>LET's GET STARTED ☀</b>

<p><b>Starting research after end term: Archive.org and Flickr</b></p>

<p>My process after the midterm started with me feeling a bit lost on what steps to take next, and with that starting to look into digital archives. I also felt that I wanted to do something less serious, and more fun. I began with looking into the Internet Archive, or Archive.org. I was really fascinated with their actions, specifically <a href="https://archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php">the bookmobile</a> and their way of working with scraping to archive web spaces.</p>

<a href="https://archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php"><img src="https://archive.org/serve/images/montage_500.jpg"></a>

<p>I ended up feeling like archive.org was too established as a political and conceptual space for me to really find something new and interesting about, which is when I moved on to one of my favorite websites for finding cool old photos, ☁Flickr!.☁</p>

<p>Personally, I use Flickr a lot to find photos that inspire me. Pinterest really algorithmically spoon-feeds you images and defines your aesthetic for you, however Flickr doesn't have any recommendation algorithms, and usually to find nice photos, I will just go through many people's profiles, their favorites, and their friends, in order to find new photos to add to my favorites. Speaking of, here are my favorites:</p>

<p><b>♬ the GEODATA map ♬</b></p>

<p>One CRAZY thing that I was always aware of on Flickr, but never really gave much thought, is the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/map">Flickr Geodata map.</a> Basically, it is an entire world map, with all the Flickr photos on it that have a geolocation marked. If you look up Eindhoven, it says there is over 100k photos there. There are only 223k people here! Maybe one day we will have more photos on the geodatamap in Eindhoven, than people.</p>

<p>I found it quite beautiful in a way, that there is such a vast digital layer of the city existing for the few people that still use Flickr to see. You can go basically anywhere in the world and find photos. However, it became clear to me rather fast that most of the pictures are taken by a slim demographic of people. This is especially clear exploring the rest of the world, and seeing many places in the global south through the eyes of mostly people with European/White American last names.</p>

<p>One defining moment in my research was looking through the Geodata map in Gaza. I felt very conflicted before trying this, as I didn't know what I would find. Anyway, what I found was that there are very many pictures taken by humanitarian aid workers. There were also many photos taken by people I assume are from Gaza, that are documenting daily life. For the rest there are some photos of cats, and also many photos by an account called John Latter, which would post very obviously AI generated photos that spread sourceless claims about things that Hamas supposedly has done. It was clear that there is some sort of mini conflict on Flickr that mirrors the real life situation, as a sort of hybrid phenomenon.</p>

<p>While this was super interesting to me, I really felt like it wouldn't be a smart idea to do a project about Gaza as of now, as I didn't feel like it would be good for me to stare at the horrifying images coming out of Gaza daily, and I needed some distance.</p>
