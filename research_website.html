<b>Welcome to my Digital native research website for after the midterms.</b>

<p>This website will look a little bit messy, the theme of the website is early 2000s/2010s webblog, to reflect the aesthetics of Flickr.</p>

<p>If it is annoying you, I recommend to turn on reader mode on your Iphone or Mac, although it might not work with Flickr embed images.</p>

<p>I am using many photos from Flickr on this page, these are clickable, to be transparent about the source.</p>

<b>LET's GET STARTED ☀</b>

<p><b>Starting research after end term: Archive.org and Flickr</b></p>

<p>My process after the midterm started with me feeling a bit lost on what steps to take next, and with that starting to look into digital archives. I began with looking into the Internet Archive, or Archive.org. I was really fascinated with their actions, specifically <a href="https://archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php">the bookmobile</a> and their way of working with scraping to archive web spaces.</p>

<p>I ended up feeling like archive.org was too established as a political and conceptual space for me to really find something new and interesting about, which is when I moved on to one of my favorite websites for finding cool old photos, ☁Flickr!.☁</p>

<p>Personally, I use Flickr a lot to find photos that inspire me. Pinterest really algorithmically spoon-feeds you images and defines your aesthetic for you, however Flickr doesn't have any recommendation algorithms, and usually to find nice photos, I will just go through many people's profiles, their favorites, and their friends, in order to find new photos to add to my favorites. Speaking of, here are my favorites:</p>
